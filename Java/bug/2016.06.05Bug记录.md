## New view in xml(layout) file cant be created(java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: No static field tv of type I)
- Apparently what was happening, I had layout with same name in my app module and my library module. So when packaging the application it was always taking the layout from my app module not library module. So I had to delete the layout in my app module and everything worked fine.
